[{"name":"Grilling","description":"Grilling is a cooking technique that can use high, medium, or even low heat, which means anything from steaks to burgers to even a whole roast can go on the grill. Cooking on a charcoal grill is trickier than using gas, but it's relatively easy to generate a burst of high heat for a short time using charcoal, so even a novice can grill steaks and burgers."},
{"name":"Braising","description":"Braising is a moist-heat cooking technique that uses lower temperatures and longer cooking times, which helps tenderize tougher cuts of beef like chuck, brisket, short ribs and round (aka rump roast). When you hear the term braising, think pot roast."},
{"name":"Stewing","description":"Like braising, stewing uses slow, moist heat. But rather than cooking a large piece of meat, we cut the meat up into cubes or other smaller pieces first, like in beef stew or chili."},
{"name":"Roasting","description":"Roasting is a dry-heat cooking technique that uses either high temperature or a combination of high and low. The high temperature is what gives the beef its mouth-watering, crispy, brown exterior, while the low temperature is what cooks it to its proper doneness."},
{"name":"Broiling","description":"Broiling is like grilling upside-down. It's a high-temperature technique where the beef is cooked just inches away from the heat source. Only, instead of above the fire, as with grilling, the meat is situated below"},
{"name":"Stir-frying","description":"Stir-frying is another quick technique for cooking beef. Specifically, thin strips that are cooked in a hot skillet or wok using a small amount of oil. The great thing about stir-frying is that all the ingredients in the dish, including vegetables, like onions and bell peppers, are cooked together in the same pan."},
{"name":"Barbecue","description":"This technique brings us back to the grill, but unlike grilling, barbecuing uses low temperatures and wood smoke to cook cuts of beef slowly, over a period of eight hours or more. Like braising, the slow, low temperatures break down the connective tissues in tough cuts of beef. But unlike braising, barbecuing uses dry heat rather than moist."},
{"name":"Combo (Skillet/Oven)","description":"Whether you start it in the skillet and finish in the oven, or the other way around, the skillet/oven technique is great for cooking steaks, particularly when they're cut at least 1 1/2 inches thick. Ribeyes and steaks from the short-loin primal, like strip steaks, T-bones, and porterhouse, are excellent choices for this method."},
{"name":"The Spruce","description":"Skille Last, but not least, the skillet is a great way to cook ground beef for use in other recipes, like spaghetti sauce, chili, tacos, or enchiladas. In general, it's best to add your ground beef to a cold skillet and then heat it slowly, as adding it to a hot skillet will cause the meat to stick and possibly burn."}]
